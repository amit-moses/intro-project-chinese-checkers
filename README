_GUI Interface_
An interactive game board with a screen for every action (game, history),
supporting the restoration of turn moves and continuation of the game, editing
player data, and the scoreboard. The implementation class is utilized for
designing objects in the GUI to match the game's design, such as the round
buttons. The interface is adjusted within the same window for viewing history,
starting a new game, continuing a game, and playing online.

_Online Game_
An online game played against players running the program from another computer
on the Internet, designed for 2 players and based on listening to changes in a
database. The first player to enter starts with an odd ID, waiting for a second
player with an even ID. The game utilizes Firebase Firestore. Only the start
and end points of the player's last move and the current turn are entered into
the database. After selecting a follower ID, each player will know which line
in the database to listen to for new moves. Closing the window deletes the
player from the database. Online games are not saved in log files, and cannot
be restored, wins and losses are updated.

_Playing Against a Computer Trying to Win_
Computerized player with the goal of finishing the game. The computer selects a
random tool or the one furthest from the vertex of the target, and brings that
tool closer to the target triangle, utilizing an analytical geometry formula
for calculating the distance between points.

_Hints_
Viewing hints for where a tool can go at the end of each turn, including skips.

_Players Data_
Support for many local players, allowing for the editing of their details.
